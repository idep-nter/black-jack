Haven't done anything in OOP for a while so I decided to create a game of Blackjack.

Fun fact - I have never played Blackjack before so I had to learn the rules which were fortunately quite easy to understand (at least I hope I've got everything right) and the whole game in general wasn't as complicated to write as I thought it'll be.

So in a nutshell:
The game starts by creating chips and a deck which is shuffled before it asks a player how much he wants to bet.
Then it creates a player's and a dealer's hand with two cards in each and three of them shows to the player.
Depending on a total value of his cards he decides if he wants take an another card or end up.
If he hits 22 or more he's lost otherwise the game continuous with a dealer's turn. The dealer is taking cards until he reaches a total value of 17 or more.
At the end it prints a result, redistributes chips and asks the player if wants to continue.
